Hello Sugar Labs

I'm Aladu Pushpendra , 17 year old boy having interest in open source and competitive programming.

Sugar Labs's sugarizer activities was real fun and i liked Physics JS very much.

Working under Sugar Labs (Sweet) and Google Code-in (and GSOC) and contributing to your work Would be great opportunity for me to learn and nurture my skills as a programmer and developer.

Hope , i would get an opportunity to work for Sugar Labs through Google summer of code in future.

A Pushpendra.
